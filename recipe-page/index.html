        <li>2 ounces of rice vermicelli noodles</li>
        <li>1 package of rice wrappers</li>
        <li>12 cooked shrimps</li>

      <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Let vermicelli noodles boil for 5 minutes, and drain into a colander and rinse noodles with cold water.</li>
          <li>Fill large bowl with hot water and in a circular motion, dip rice wrapper into hot water to soften. Lay soften wrapper on flat surface.</li>
